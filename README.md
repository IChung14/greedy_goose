# Greedy Goose

Greedy Goose is an entertainment application and productivity tool that helps users with effective time management for their phone usage. 

The 'Entertainment' mode is a pre-programmed, interactive sequence in which Mr. Greedy Goose carries out a series of actions overlayed onto the current screen. The user can customize outfits, collect eggs, feed Mr. Goose, wipe away muddy footprints and drag Mr. Goose around. The 'Productivity' mode features a timer that allows users to set a limit for their screen time. Provided with a list of currently downloaded applications, users can choose which ones they deem to be unproductive and will be applied to the time limit. Upon expiration and until dismissed, Mr. Goose will appear and carry out a series of actions to encourage the user to put their phone away.

This application supports Android operating systems with:
  - targetSDK: 32
  - minSDK:    26
